      "body" : "some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than in aerodynamic research . a study is made of the advantages that can be realized in compressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air . most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic, chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio of specific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is based on the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a suitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas mixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is nontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and comprised of commercially available components . calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs comprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of three monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a given mach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture wind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be appreciably smaller and would require much less power than a corresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantages can be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research . the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and proportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel temperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at flight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel temperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve the relaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with temperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall within this category .  other applications arise in heat-transfer research since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl number in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .",

(2) there always exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a similar result was obtained by synge from energy considerations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the motion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence the qualitative shape of the curve is determined .   the author proceeds to show that simple approximate expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his general analysis for a given velocity profile .  these approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds numbers are based on the width of the channel and the displacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method for computing the complete instability curve is presented and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked out in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been given before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned . the value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for poiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion mentioned above is thus very good .   a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous effects and of future developments concludes the paper .",

      "body" : "interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes . the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes . part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the  development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction  depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream  of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface . many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in  practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore, frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight  and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information  is at present available on this point . most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation  between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock  waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain  unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation . some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce . some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of  the paper .",

      "body" : "a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under axial compression and bending .   the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal deflections .  experimental failure stresses range from 0.6 to 0.15 of the theoretical .  the discrepancy is apparently considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens than for duralumin and increases with the radius- thickness ratio .  there is an equally great discrepancy between observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections .   in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is developed, which permits initial eccentricities or deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered .  true instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,. the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum stress reaches the yield point .  the effect of initial eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for the case of simple struts .  measurements of initial eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,. however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the magnitudes of these components of the deviations .  with these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio .  on the basis of this a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves relations suggested by the theory but is based on experimental data .   it is shown that similar discrepancies between experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation buckling problems can probably be explained by similar considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems . the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other applications as well .   the paper presents the results of about a hundred new tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending, which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .",

      "body" : "turbulent diffusion in the wake of a blunt nosed body at hypersonic speeds .   at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10 corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid wake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion and conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formed by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the surface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows enthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer inviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it behaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/ wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of the body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flight velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body . tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the wake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .   in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as electron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure diffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for m = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for the case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300 mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that the width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma requency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude . these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion recombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .",

      "body" : "note on creep buckling of columns .   the phenomenological theory previously proposed in naca technical note 4000 for the behavior of metals at elevated temperatures has been modified to yield transient creep curves by assuming that the metal consists of two phases, each with its own elasticity and viscosity .  the extended theory satisfies the basic requirements for a theory of transient creep at elevated temperatures .. that the transient creep be closely connected with the subsequent steady creep, and that the apparent exponent of the time in the transient region be permitted wide variations between 0 and 1 .  from this theory it is possible to construct nondimensional creep curves which extend continuously from the transient region into the steady-state region .  the corresponding family of creep curves for any metal may be obtained from the nondimensional family by use of appropriate constants .  the constants required are those obtained from steady creep measurements, together with two additional constants which represent the difference between the phases .  the transient creep curves resulting from this theory are compared with the experimental curves for pure aluminum, gamma iron, lead, and agreement is found .",

(1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development .  since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream .  however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .",
